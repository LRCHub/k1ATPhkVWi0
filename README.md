[00:00.14] No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
[00:08.00] There's a whole crowd of people out there
[00:10.43] Who need to learn how to do the Scarn
[00:28.93] 
[00:13.20] Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
[00:17.93] Learned my lesson way too long ago
[00:22.34] To be talking to you, belladonna
[00:25.05] Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
[00:27.54] Take what I want when I wanna
[00:30.22] And I want ya
[00:36.72] 
[00:32.27] Bad, bad news
[00:34.29] One of us is gonna lose
[00:36.76] I'm the powder, you're the fuse
[00:39.89] Just add some friction
[00:50.89] 
[00:41.87] You are my strange addiction
[00:46.75] You are my strange addiction
[00:51.38] My doctors can't explain
[00:53.65] My symptoms or my pain
[00:56.12] But you are my strange addiction
[01:12.12] 
[01:01.13] I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
[01:04.68] To see that Micheal Scarn got his confidence back
[01:06.57] Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing, though
[01:07.84] It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life
[01:37.34] 
[01:10.67] Deadly fever, please don't ever break
[01:15.25] Be my reliever 'cause I don't self-medicate
[01:20.14] And it burns like a gin and I like it
[01:22.50] Put your lips on my skin, and you might ignite it
[01:25.27] Hurts, but I know how to hide it
[01:27.91] Kinda like it
[01:34.41] 
[01:30.07] Bad, bad news
[01:31.83] One of us is gonna lose
[01:34.29] I'm the powder, you're the fuse
[01:37.32] Just add some friction
[01:48.32] 
[01:39.64] You are my strange addiction
[01:44.23] You are my strange addiction
[01:48.92] My doctors can't explain
[01:51.36] My symptoms or my pain
[01:53.77] But you are my strange addiction
[02:09.77] 
[02:03.65] Bite my glass, set myself on fire
[02:07.92] Can't you tell I'm a crass? Can't you tell I'm wired?
[02:12.77] Tell me "nothing lasts," like I don't know
[02:17.72] You could kiss my-, asking about my motto
[02:38.22] 
[02:23.19] You should enter in festivals, or carnivals
[02:27.03] Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
[02:29.03] It's pretty cool, right?
[02:41.03] 
[02:32.27] You are my strange addiction
[02:37.30] You are my strange addiction
[02:41.71] My doctors can't explain
[02:44.01] My symptoms or my pain
[02:46.52] But you are my strange addiction
[03:02.52] 
[02:55.53] Did you like it? Did you like that?
[02:57.61] Um, which part?
